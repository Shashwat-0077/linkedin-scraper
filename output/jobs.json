We are moving beyond simple chatbots to build a proprietary Agentic AI Platform.Our mission is to solve the global mental health access crisis by building AI that is fundamentally safe. We use multi-agent architectures to design, simulate, and validate therapeutic protocols under strict clinical governance. We are combining the speed of Generative AI with the safety rigor of medical devices.We are a small, expert team working directly with leading clinical academics and experienced founders in a flat, high-trust environment.The RoleWe are looking for a high-velocity AI Engineer who lives at the intersection of modern full stack software development and Agentic AI.In this role, you will be instrumental in engineering the orchestration layer that manages multiple AI agents (Designers, Critics, Safety Supervisors) and building the interfaces that allow clinicians to interact with them. You will work on \"Safety-by-Design\" Agentic AI—one of the most critical and unsolved challenges in the industry.We value engineers who are highly adaptable, fast learners, and who embrace AI-assisted development tools (like Cursor, Claude Code etc.) to amplify their output and solve complex problems at speed.Key Responsibilities      Agentic Orchestration: Design and implement complex, stateful multi-agent workflows using LangGraph and LangChain. Build the logic for agents that propose content, check it against safety rules, and refine it autonomously.Frontend Development: Build sophisticated, responsive applications that visualise agentic workflows, allowing human experts to review, edit, and approve AI-generated clinical protocols.Safety Implementation: Implement \"Supervisory Agents\" that strictly enforce clinical boundaries to ensure safety and clinical fidelity.System Optimization: Work on optimizing the latency of agentic loops to enable real-time stress testing and simulation of therapeutic conversations.Rapid Prototyping: Use AI-assisted coding tools to rapidly prototype, debug, and iterate on new features.\nRequirements1) Technical Skills:      Frontend Capable: Proficiency in TypeScript and modern UI development. While React & React Native is our preferred stack, we are open to engineers strong in other frameworks (Vue, Svelte) or those willing to learn React & React Native quickly. You must be able to build functional UIs to visualize agent workflows.AI Frameworks: Deep hands-on experience with Python, LangChain, and critically, LangGraph. You understand stateful, cyclic agentic graphs (beyond simple RAG chains).Architecture: Solid understanding of event-driven architectures, state machines, and asynchronous processing.\n2) Soft Skills & Attributes:      AI-Augmented Workflow: You are proficient in using AI coding assistants (e.g., Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot) to accelerate development and explore new libraries.Fast Learner: You have a track record of rapidly picking up new tools and frameworks as they emerge. You thrive on \"figuring it out.\"Problem Solver: You approach complex technical challenges with creativity and autonomy.\n3) Nice to Have:      Experience in Digital Health, MedTech, or highly regulated industries.Familiarity with vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.).Experience with cloud infrastructure (GCP/AWS) and serverless deployment.\nWhy Join Us?      Work on the Frontier: Build cutting-edge Agentic AI systems that push the boundaries of what is possible in healthcare.Real Impact: Your code will directly contribute to making mental healthcare safer and more accessible for thousands of people.Remote & Flexible: We care about output and problem-solving, not hours in a chair.\nOur Recruitment ProcessWe do not believe in broken recruitment practices like whiteboard coding or algorithmic quizzes. We believe the only way to evaluate an engineer is to see them build.      Application: You submit the form below.The Protocol Sprint: If shortlisted, you will receive a 72-hour architectural challenge (designed to be completed over a weekend). You will build a complex Agentic System using the AI tools of your choice.The Review: We review your code and Loom video.Final Interview: We discuss your architecture and make an offer.\nHow to ApplyTo apply, please complete the form below:- https://forms.gle/Jw37vA1fB3KjFuAw9",

Geospatial Interfaces: Develop advanced map layers and responsive components using Mapbox or similar libraries for real-time geospatial monitoring. AI-Driven UI: Implement frontends that respond dynamically to natural-language prompts and JSON outputs from AI agents. Workflow Tools: Design and build GUI-based tools for configuring data pipelines (e.g., “Connect source → Trigger forecasting agent → Load to DB”). Secure Access & Authentication: Integrate authentication mechanisms (OAuth2, JWT) and coordinate with backend teams to ensure secure multi-tenant access. Collaboration: Work closely with backend and AI teams to ensure smooth data integration, performance optimization, and real-time responsiveness. \nTech Stack      Core: React / Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS Visualization: D3.js, Recharts, Mapbox Integration: AWS Amplify, REST APIs, JSON-based agent responses \nWhat You Bring      Proven experience developing responsive, real-time dashboards and visualization interfaces.
